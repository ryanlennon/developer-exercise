I'm new to backbone.js and it's really cool to learn about new ways of pullling in JSON data.
I couldnt quite get the data to show on my app page, but I will continue to look for possible solutions.
I have the backbone setup, but with seeing the data still can't set up pagination.
Going to keep at it!
