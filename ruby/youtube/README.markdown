##Youtube Readme

I created a Rails application and constructed a youtube app so the code for
the .rb and .erb files comes from that application. Basically you need to put it in 
a rails app to get it going.

To create a quick rails app:

-rails new youtube

-cd youtube

-rails generate controller youtubes

and then create a route and view and thats it! Enjoy!
