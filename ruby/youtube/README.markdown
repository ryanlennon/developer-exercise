##Youtube Readme

I created a Rails application and constructed a youtube app so the code for
the .rb and .erb files comes from that application. 

To create a quick rails app:

-rails new youtube

-cd youtube

-rails generate controller youtubes, and then create a route and view

or if you have a rails app you can place it in your own control and view and test it out!

Thats it! Enjoy!
